# Pizza Ordering System
This was my first ever Flask project using Python & Bootstrap. It was set as a homework for my Year 12 Class.   
Feel free to take and use any of the code you want, not much use to me anymore.

# Config
The only configuration necessary is the email server where you should enter the respective details
